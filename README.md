# TrailsyServer

This will eventually provide:

 - a REST-style interface to trail data for consumption by [Trailsy](http://www.github.com/danavery/trailsy) (and possibly others). 
 - an interface for trail stewards to upload and maintain their trail data in the Trailsy database, as well as provide status and closure updates for invidivual trails.

This is still very much in early development. We hope to merge this repo and the [Trailsy](http://www.github.com/danavery/trailsy) repo soon.
